This is "Readable" my second Project for the Udacity React Nanodegree.

To launch the project you'll need to:
1) Clone the repository
2) Clone the server from https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter
3) In a terminal window navigate to the project and run npm install && npm start
4) In a separate terminal window navigate to the server and run npm install && node server
5) The project will be served at localhost:3000 and the server will listen on port 3001

I found the work of https://github.com/janstoff to be particularly helpful and corresponded with him about my project.
